# Meeting 01: Simulation de pentest

This repositorey was created to store the documents from the first meeting of the UMONS Red Dragons Hackers Club.
In it, you will find:
- An example of notes structure and content, based on the presented box (Love from HTB)
- An example of good report
- The slides presented during the meeting

Reminded that everything in this repository is not perfect. Everyone has their own ways of taking notes, of writing reports and such. The documents in this repository serve the purpose of providing beginners with "good" example to help them start and build their own way of working.
